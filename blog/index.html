                I've always wanted to do reviews of my favorite games. It's also an archival place
                where I can post random things that may be useful to others down the line trying
                to 100% games or something. So hope you enjoy my little corner of the internet!
                Even if there isn't much here yet...

            <h1 class="title">Portraits of Pizza (from Chicory)</h1>
            <h4 class="date">October 10, 2021</h4>

            <p>
                I was recently replaying through a game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1123450/Chicory_A_Colorful_Tale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicory</a>.
                and came across a part where someone paints the main character.
                Based on the player's responses, the game gives you a different
                portrait of Pizza - the main character of the game. Depending
                on what answers you give to a couple of questions, you get a
                different portrait of your character. I really liked the variety of
                options so I figured I'd try to capture all of them...

            <h1 class="title">Favorite Indies Over the Decade</h1>
            <h4 class="date">December 30, 2020</h4>

            <p>
                With the year coming to a close, I figure I would share some of my favorite games in the past decade.
                Many of these games are singleplayer only since that&apos;s normally what I play - especially on my
                <span title="Not to be confused with my ethernet switch or HDMI switch which are both connected to my Nintendo Switch">Switch.</span>
                Below are the banners of the games. Clicking on an image will show more info...

            <h1 class="title">Struggles of a Programmer</h1>
            <h4 class="date">August 1, 2020</h4>

            <p>
                Over the years, I&apos;ve spent countless hours programming. In fact, I&apos;ve enjoyed it so much that
                I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science! With me doing so much programming these days,
                I&apos;ve learnt a lot more on how to think like a computer (well, minus all the proofs; computers
                don&apos;t really think in those). The problem is many common words now have completely different
                meanings to me now. I figure I might as well make a running list of all of these
                just for the fun of it. Again, this is all in jest; as GLaDOS once said...

            <h1 class="title">Windows Archive Script using 7-Zip</h1>
            <h4 class="date">June 7, 2020</h4>

            <p>Back in the days I had an old prebuilt, I'd have to frequently reinstall windows since some part of the operating system didn't cooperate
                with some part of the hardware. As a result, I ended up having to backup my data quite often. Because it was so frequent I made a script
                to help automate it. I figured I might as well share it with the world in case someone else needs something like this.
                Since it's geared towards backing up an entire system (including multiple drives), this script is highly multithreaded...</p>

            <h1 class="title">Breath of the Wild Geo Hunt</h1>
            <h4 class="date">May 16, 2020</h4>

            <p>Hey there! Welcome to my first article! I've actually had this idea
                in the back of my head since 2017 (crazy to think it's been out for that long)
                but I never actually finished it. I had the idea while I was replaying through
                the game again and I thought it'd be super fun. So I've rounded up a handful
                from my screenshots folder to try out!</p>

            <h2>Geo Hunt?</h2>
            <p>I'm not sure if "Geo Hunt" is the proper term, but the concept itself is straight forward. Basically
                I've taken screenshots of random locations all around Hyrule.
                Your job is to find where exactly these pictures were taken.
                Try using context clues and hints to figure out where exactly it is!
                If you find them all of them you get...</p>
