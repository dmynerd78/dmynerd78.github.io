                I've always wanted to do reviews of my favorite games. It's also an archival place
                where I can post random things that may be useful to others down the line trying
                to 100% games or something. So hope you enjoy my little corner of the internet!
                Even if there isn't much here yet...

            <p>Hey there! Welcome to my first article! I've actually had this idea
                in the back of my head since 2017 (crazy to think it's been out for that long)
                but I never actually finished it. I had the idea while I was replaying through
                the game again and I thought it'd be super fun. So I've rounded up a handful
                from my screenshots folder to try out!</p>

            <h2>Geo Hunt?</h2>
            <p>I'm not sure if "Geo Hunt" is the proper term, but the concept itself is straight forward. Basically
                I've taken screenshots of random locations all around Hyrule.
                Your job is to find where exactly these pictures were taken.
                Try using context clues and hints to figure out where exactly it is!
                If you find them all of them you get free
                <span title="Cookies not included (unless you count browser cookies).">cookies!<sup>*</sup></span></p>

            <p>If you need to see the image in higher detail, just click the image itself for the full resolution picture.
               If you're stumped with an image, you can click the black hint box beneath an image for a bit more info. Happy hunting!</p>

            <p>Hope you have fun doing this little hunt. Let me know how many you find!</p>
            <p>If you really like it, let me know &mdash; I may soon have enough for a second geo hunt.
               And who knows, I may revisit this concept when BotW's sequel comes out.</p>
