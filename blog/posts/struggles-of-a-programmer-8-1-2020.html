            <br><br>

            <p id="introduction">
                Over the years, I&apos;ve spent countless hours programming. In fact, I&apos;ve enjoyed it so much that
                I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science! With me doing so much programming these days,
                I&apos;ve learnt a lot more on how to think like a computer (well, minus all the proofs; computers
                don&apos;t really think in those). The problem is many common words now have completely different
                meanings to me now. I figure I might as well make a running list of all of these
                just for the fun of it. Again, this is all in jest; as GLaDOS once said in
                <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portal 2</a>,
                &quot;Comedy equals tragedy plus time.&quot; So let the comedy begin!
            </p>

            <h2 id="counting">Counting</h2>
            <p>
                One of the more frustrating ones is counting. Normal people count by starting at 1. However computers
                are anything but normal people. Instead of starting at one when I count, I keep catching myself starting at 0 (darn off-by-one errors amiright?).
                Why would I start at 0? Well in programming, a common task is to go through a whole list of items by
                accessing each one at it&apos;s index. However, the first item isn&apos;t at index one. Instead it&apos;s at index <em>zero</em>.
                As a result, you often see code looking similar to this:

                <br><br>
                <code><span class="gray">// Create a list of elements</span>
<span class="purple">var</span> <span class="red">items</span> = [<span class="green">"item1"</span>, <span class="green">"item2"</span>, <span class="green">"item3"</span>, <span class="green">"item4"</span>, <span class="gray">...,</span> <span class="green">"itemX"</span>];

<span class="gray">// Notice how i starts at 0</span>
<span class="gray">// So when getting item1, we use index 0</span>
<span class="purple">for</span>(<span class="purple">var</span> <span class="red">i</span><span class="cyan">=</span><span class="gold">0</span>; <span class="red">i</span><span class="cyan">&lt;</span><span class="red">items.length</span>; <span class="red">i</span><span class="cyan">++</span>) {
    <span class="blue">print</span>(<span class="red">items</span>[<span class="red">i</span>]); <span class="gray">// Prints item at index i</span>
}
</code>
            </p>

            <p>
                While this may seem strange, it&apos;s due to how items are stored within memory. More specifically, it&apos;s
                because of memory addressing and how offset on it works. It gets a little technical so I&apos;ll just leave
                it as that. If you&apos;re curious feel free to do some research of your own!
            </p>

            <h2 id="number-base">Number Base</h2>
            <p>
                We humans use a numbering system that is Base 10. Meaning we have 10 different available numbers (0-9) in each
                position<span title="Make sure to starting counting at one and not zero">*</span>.
                When we reach 9 and want to add 1 to it, we have to carry over to the tens place. As a budding computer
                scientist, you learn that computers do not use a Base 10 numbering scheme. Instead, they use Binary, or Base 2.
                As the name implies, <em>bi</em>nary has 2 available numbers (0-1) in each position. So if we have the number
                1<sub>2</sub> (the subscript denotes it&apos;s base 2), adding 1<sub>2</sub> to it would create the number 10<sub>2</sub>
                (1<sub>2</sub> + 1<sub>2</sub> = 10<sub>2</sub> = 2<sub>10</sub>). Just like with our base 10 system when we hit 9<sub>10</sub>, we have to carry
                to the next digit.
            </p>

            <p>
                To further complicate matters, binary is not the only base system used within computers. Another very common one is
                Hexadecimal &dash; or Base 16. This means there are 16 different numbers to increment through before you have to carry.
                These are numbered 0-9 and then A-F (A-F stands for 10<sub>10</sub> to 15<sub>10</sub> respectively).
                So this means F<sub>16</sub> + 1<sub>16</sub> = 10<sub>16</sub> = 16<sub>10</sub>
            </p>

            <p>
                With just these three bases, the number "10" could mean 10<sub>10</sub>, 2<sub>10</sub>, or 16<sub>10</sub> depending
                on the base in which the number is in! As a result, it&apos;s sometimes difficult to figure out
                what number a number is when you&apos;re trying to read it. Especially after programming in a language called C
                which makes heavy use of shifting and modifying individual bits within numbers.
            </p>

            <h3 id="2s-compliment">2s Compliment</h3>
            <p>
                Further complicating matters, numbers can either be &quot;signed&quot; or &quot;unsigned&quot;.
                I won&apos;t go into the specifics here, but essentially unsigned numbers can only represent
                non-negative numbers. To allow for negative numbers, you have to make the number &quot;signed&quot;.
                This is often done in the 2s Complement format where the far left (or most significant) number
                is made one to denote it&apos;s negative.
            </p>

            <p>
                This means that &quot;10&quot;, if unsigned, could be
                10<sub>10</sub>, 2<sub>10</sub>, or 16<sub>10</sub> <em>or</em> some sort of negative number
                if it&apos;s signed. Talk about confusing when you see something costs $10!
            </p>

            <h2 id="ranges">Ranges</h2>
            <p>
                In many classes, it&apos;s typical to hear the teacher say something like &quot;read chapters 3 to 5 for homework.&quot; A programmer may
                ask, &quot;Is the 5 inclusive or exclusive?&quot; Why would they ask this? Let&apos;s take a look at some example Python code:

                <code><span class="purple">for</span> num <span class="purple">in</span> <span class="cyan">range</span>(<span>3</span>, <span>5</span>):
    <span class="cyan">print</span>(num)</code>

                Looking at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#ranges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python Documentation</a>,
                it notes that the range of values printed is <em>exclusive</em> i.e. it would print 3 and 4 but not 5. Many for loops have an exclusive range
                &dash; especially when indexing within the loop (<a href="#counting">the for loop in the counting example</a> is also exclusive)
            </p>

            <p>
                As a result, many ranges are exclusive within programming while many ranges used by people are inclusive ranges. It can be slightly confusing
                to determine whether someone means inclusive or exclusive if they do not specify.
            </p>

            <h2 id="or">Or</h2>
            <p>
                &quot;Should I ride by bike today or go swimming?&quot; Similar to <a href="#ranges">ranges</a>, is the or exclusive or inclusive? Is the person
                able to go biking <em>and</em> go swimming? Or can they only do one? In programming, there are two types of &quot;or&quot;s you can use.
                Typically, the first one is <code class="inline">||</code> and the second one is <code class="inline">^</code> (the caret does not mean exponent).
                As alluded to, the first one allows for the both case whereas the second does not allow for it. Just like all the others, this leads to
                the question &quot;Which or are you talking about?&quot;
            </p>

            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Basically, computers are really complicated which causes programmers to &quot;think like a computer.&quot; This mindset can lead to
                confusion or miscounting. After a long week of looking at machine code, you may accidentally think the number 10 actually represents 16<sub>10</sub>
                when in fact it&apos;s 10<sub>10</sub>. You may also get confused on what is exclusive or exclusive when it comes to options <span title="See what I did there?">or</span>
                ranges. Implicit assumptions can sometimes lead to wrong conclusions. Again, while I have personally had all these issues after many long weeks of college programming
                assignments, this is all in jest. Hope you enjoyed it! If not, sorry for such a nerdy article.
