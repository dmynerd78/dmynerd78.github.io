                I've always wanted to do reviews of my favorite games. It's also an archival place
                where I can post random things that may be useful to others down the line trying
                to 100% games or something. So hope you enjoy my little corner of the internet!
                Even if there isn't much here yet...

                    I found this while getting all the blank pages from the game. It seems like a draft version of the
                    first introduction page. Might as well leave this here for your viewing pleasure.
