This leads to the game exploring many topics that just aren&apos;t talked about much in many more mainstream games.

Just like Charon, you ferry spirits and help them with their daily needs until they are ready to move on to the afterlife. This is done by expanding your ship&apos;s facilities by gathering resources from the surrounding islands. The game does an excellent job managing tasks which prevents them from getting monotonous. It also does an excellent job getting to that first step of talking about death in a creative way; your job as the spirit farer is to help spirits move on but in doing so, it becomes very hard to say that final goodbye.

        "description": `<p>This game absolutely took the internet by storm when it came out and for good reason. You are a goose whose only purpose in life is to ruin everyone&apos;s day. Activities on the agenda include: have a picnic (by stealing the local gardener&apos;s food), go shopping (forcing a kid to buy his own toys back in the process), and reign supreme as a bird of prey. It&apos;s a very silly game that will bring much laughter to those who play it. Plus there&apos;s a dedicated button for honking.</p>`

The gist of the story is Zagreus is attempting to leave the underworld and gets aid from the Olympus gods. You go through four major areas each with different atmospheres and enemies. Each run (no matter how far you get) furthers your progress in the story making the inevitable death easier to bear.</p>`
